# OB-livious

This repository will contain Olivia and Brie's code for our full stack
adventure.

Brie is an embedded systems engineer, and Olivia is a front end
developer. By our powers combined, we plan to conquer the full
engineering stack from embedded IOT devices all the way through the
front end app.
